LightboxGallery
===============

The **Lightbox Gallery** plugin adds two new layouts to Exhibit Builder. One layout displays attached files in a gallery format, while the other allows you to choose a size for a single image and align it left or right. Files displayed using these layouts link to a Lightbox overlay of a larger version of the image. Captions display underneath the large image in Lightbox, rather than underneath the thumbnail images.

These layouts will assign the same Lightbox grouping to all items they add to a page. So, if you add multiple Lightbox Gallery or File with Text blocks to your exhibit page, all the items in those blocks will show up in the Lightbox gallery. (Files added with other layouts will not show up in the Lightbox gallery.)

These layouts are based on the _Gallery_ and _File with Text_ layouts that come with [Exhibit Builder](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-ExhibitBuilder),  developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. They use [Lightbox2](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2), developed by Lokesh Dhakar.
