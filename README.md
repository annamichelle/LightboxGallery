LightboxGallery
===============

*This plugin is still in development and might not be working just yet! Check back in a couple weeks.* 

The **Lightbox Gallery** plugin adds a new layout to Exhibit Builder. This layout displays attached files in a gallery
format. Thumbnails in the gallery link to a Lightbox display of a larger version, with a caption that links to the item
page.

This layout is based on the Gallery layout that comes with [Exhibit Builder](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-ExhibitBuilder), 
developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. It uses 
[Lightbox2](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2), developed by Lokesh Dhakar
