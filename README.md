LightboxGallery
===============

The **Lightbox Gallery** plugin adds a new layout to Exhibit Builder. This layout displays attached files in a gallery
format. Thumbnails in the gallery link to a Lightbox overlay of a larger version of the image. Captions display
underneath the Lightbox, rather than underneath the thumbnail images.

This layout will assign the same Lightbox grouping to all items it adds to a page. So, if you add multiple Lightbox Gallery
blocks to your exhibit page, all the items in those blocks will show up in the Lightbox gallery. (Files added with other layouts
will not show up in the Lightbox Gallery.) You can use this layout as an alternative to the "File with Text" layout by setting
the "Showcase File" option for a single file. This allows you to display a fullsize version of the file AND include it as part 
of your Lightbox gallery.

This layout is based on the Gallery layout that comes with [Exhibit Builder](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-ExhibitBuilder), 
developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. It uses 
[Lightbox2](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2), developed by Lokesh Dhakar.
