LightboxGallery
===============

The **Lightbox Gallery** plugin adds a new layout to Exhibit Builder. This layout displays attached files in a gallery
format. Thumbnails in the gallery link to a Lightbox overlay of a larger version of the image. Captions display
underneath the Lightbox, rather than underneath the thumbnail images.

This layout is based on the Gallery layout that comes with [Exhibit Builder](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-ExhibitBuilder), 
developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. It uses 
[Lightbox2](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2), developed by Lokesh Dhakar
